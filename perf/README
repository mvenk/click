All the radix[1-6].click files contain the 167k regression test. 

The testrunner.sh file runs each one of these files using "click
radix[1-6].click" and times the result using the "time" program. 

The testrunner.sh takes an argument N which is the number of times
each click file needs to be run. The times are averaged and stored in
a ".click.out" file.

Usage:

	./testrunner.sh <N>

The "mean.sh" program computes the mean wall clock time and also the
maximum resident working set. The "mean" binary program (used by
"mean.sh") computes the average of the numbers it sees on stdin.
