All the radix[1-6].click files contain the 167k regression test. 

The testrunner.sh file runs each one of these files using "click
radix[1-6].click" and times the result using the "time" program. 

The testrunner.sh takes an argument N which is the number of times
each click file needs to be run. The times are averaged and stored in
a ".click.out" file.

Usage:

	./testrunner.sh <N>

The "mean.sh" program computes the mean wall clock time and also the
maximum resident working set. The "mean" binary program (used by
"mean.sh") computes the average of the numbers it sees on stdin.

Edit the testrunner.sh file to choose which one of the RadixIPLookup
elements should be chosen to run in the test. The description of each
RadixIPLookup element is given below.

Element			Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------
RadixIPLookup		The original RadixIPLookup element. With
			branching factor 2^8 at the first level and 2^4
			after that.

RadixIPLookup2		Radix nodes memaligned to 64 bytes. Branching
			factor of 2^12 at first level and 2^5 after that.

RadixIPLookup3		Branching factor of 2^8 at first level and 2^3
			after that.

RadixIPLookup4		Branching factor of 2^8 at first level and 2^2
			after that.

RadixIPLookup5		Branching factor of 2^16 at first level and
			2^4 after that.

RadixIPLookup6		Radix nodes memaligned to 64 bytes. Super
			children allocated in a separate call to
			new. Branching factor of 2^8 at the first
			level and 2^3 after that.

RadixIPLookup7		RadixIPLookup7 doesn't have the following
			member fields "_bitshift", "_n",
			"_nchildren". These fields are derived
			automatically from the depth at which a
			particular node is at. It has additional
			functions to calculate these fields.
