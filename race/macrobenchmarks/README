SUMMARY
=======

This folder contains macro-benchmarks to test the performance of competing
synchronization strategies within Click for IP Lookup. The synchronization
strategies benchmarked are: RCU, RW lock, mutex and no locking.

RUNNING TESTS
=============

It's better to run the tests through the Makefile, because we like abusing make
for everything. 

        make n=5

Issuing the above command will run the tests 5 times, average the results and
put them in a log file. The log files can be found in the folder named "out."

NAMING CONVENTION
=================

The naming convention for the .click files found in this folder is as follows:

    <routing table>_test_<strategy>_<readers>r_<writers>w.click

"routing table" is one of:
    167k    -- 167k route routing table from routeviews.
    366k    -- 366k route routing table from routeviews.
    1m_20   -- All 1 million /20 routes.
    1m_gt20 -- 1 million routes uniformly distributed over prefixes > /20.
    1m_32   -- 1 million routes uniformly distribute over the /32 prefix.

"strategy" is one of:
    rwl -- Reader writer lock
    rcu -- Read Copy Update
    mut -- Mutex
    non -- No locking

"readers" is the number of readers and similarly "writers" is the number of
writers. 

For example, "167k_test_1r_0w_non.click" is a test run on the 167k routing table
with 1 reader, 0 writers and does not use any locking.
